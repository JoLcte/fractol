# fractol

Here is a fun graphic project from 42School I took time to create, just because the color techniques were interesting, and the speed and fluidity handling too.
On that last point, my thread handling isn't good enough. I can optimize it, and we still can see some weird images cut while moving to much before it calculated
the last image result.


To navigate in the program, type H to print the functions of the different keys
Also, at the end of the compilation, you should have some options with the Makefile you can use to modify some colors, size of screen and so on.

Have fun :D
